I built this project using ReactJS and material-UI framework. I was also able to collect
weather information with axios using the Weather API from openweathermap.org.

I implemented the following features:

• User can view the weather in his/her current location.

• Weather icon will change depending on weather conditions.

• User can search for weather information of other places.

For me, my major motivation for building this project was to learn how to access returned
data from the API response and use it in different ways. Although my methodology needs
improvements, it’s bound to get better with constant practice.
